Hi there! I'm Amar.
As of right now I'm trying to learn a lot about game development and object oriented programming.
Main goal is to make a simple side-scroller videogame in Godot, my main inspiration being "Streets of Rage". (look it up, it's a good game)
Other than that, I study IT at IBU, do a little bit of activism here and there, nothing special ya know.
Open to collaborations, internships, work, casual conversation regarding obscure topics I know nothing about.




"Hey"
    "Yeah?"
"You ever wonder why we're here?"
    "It's one of lifes greatest mysteries, isn't it?"
